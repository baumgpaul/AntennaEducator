- **Microservice Architecture**: Independent, scalable services for pre/post processing and solving
- **Web-Based Access**: Full-featured React frontend for interactive 3D antenna design
- **Research Foundation**: Based on validated MATLAB implementation with 4 years of HF simulation expertise

   - Use cases: Arrays, feed networks, reflectors, parasitic elements
   - Impact: Major Redux state restructure needed

2. **Spatial Positioning System**

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Three.js Performance**: Don't create new geometries on every render. Use `useMemo` and `useRef`.
2. **State Management**: Don't over-use Redux. Use React Query for server state.
3. **API Calls**: Always handle loading and error states. Use React Query's built-in features.
4. **TypeScript**: Don't use `any`. Define proper interfaces for all API responses.
5. **Docker Networking**: Use service names (not localhost) for inter-container communication.
6. **CORS**: Configure FastAPI CORS middleware to allow frontend origin.

### Success Criteria

At the end of Phase 2, you should have:

✅ A working React frontend with Material-UI  
✅ Login and project management pages  
✅ 3D antenna design interface with Three.js  
✅ Full integration with backend APIs  
✅ Docker Compose deployment running all services  
✅ Ability to create a dipole, solve it, and see impedance  
✅ Documentation for developers and users  
✅ Clean, maintainable code with TypeScript  

### Getting Help

- **Backend Issues**: Check FastAPI logs, test with Swagger UI (http://localhost:8002/docs)
- **Frontend Issues**: Use React DevTools, Redux DevTools
- **Three.js Issues**: Check Three.js Inspector Chrome extension
- **Docker Issues**: Use `docker-compose logs -f <service>` to debug

## Finalized Architecture Decisions

The following architectural and technical decisions have been confirmed for the project:

### Frontend Stack (Confirmed)

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Frontend Framework** | **React 18+ with TypeScript** | Largest ecosystem, excellent Three.js integration, industry standard |
| **3D Visualization** | **Three.js** | Lightweight, better for scientific visualization, mature WebGL library |
| **UI Component Library** | **Material-UI (MUI)** | Comprehensive component set, mature, excellent documentation |
| **State Management** | **Redux Toolkit** | Industry standard, excellent DevTools, predictable state container |

### Deployment Strategy (Confirmed)

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Local Development** | **Docker Desktop** | Better Windows support, standard tooling |
| **AWS Compute** | **Lambda (Phase 1)** → **EKS (Phase 2)** | Start simple and cheap, scale to Kubernetes for larger jobs |
| **Database (Standalone)** | **PostgreSQL** | Feature-rich, JSON support, open-source |

### Feature Priorities (Confirmed)

| Decision | Choice | Implementation Plan |
|----------|--------|---------------------|
| **Authentication** | **AWS Cognito (Cloud)** + **Token-based (Docker)** | Cognito for production AWS deployment, simple JWT for local Docker mode |
| **Real-Time Updates** | **Polling (Phase 1)** → **WebSockets (Phase 4)** | Start with simple polling, upgrade to WebSockets for better UX in Phase 4 |
| **Export Formats** | **ParaView (.vtu) only** | Focus on ParaView first; HFSS/CST formats not currently planned |

### Technical Constraints (Confirmed)

| Constraint | Current Limit | Future Target | Notes |
|------------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| **Problem Size** | ~1,000 edges, 100 freq. points | 10,000+ edges on EKS | Lambda memory limit; EKS for larger problems |
| **Frequency Range** | 10 MHz - 5 GHz (validated) | Maintain current range | Thin-wire assumption breaks at very high frequencies |
| **Field Visualization** | 50×50×50 grid (125k points) | User adjustable | Configurable in UI based on performance needs |
